# Netflix Movie Recommendation | Machine Learning Recommendation System 

**Objective** 
- Deploy a model to predict the rating that a user would give to a movie that he has not yet rated <br/>
- Minimize the difference between predicted and actual rating (RMSE and MAPE) <br/>

**Approach**
- Integrated data from multiple CSV files containing **10crore+** user data and **17k+** movies into a single DataFrame <br/>
- Applied **EDA** on Time-series, imputed missing values, and preprocessed data to improve the model's accuracy <br/>
- Evaluated models for recommendation using **Item-Item** similarity, **Matrix-Factorization & Collaborative Filtering** <br/>
- Implemented **RMSE** for model evaluation and improved the base score after **post-processing and model stacking** <br/>

**Conclusion** 
- Achieved **RMSE** score of **1.06** and **MAPE** score of **33.37** for prediction of the user rating on test data <br/>
